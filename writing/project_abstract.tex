% 30 lines of text

An essential aspect of both translational medicine and human 
health-based team science is the integration of biomedical research 
results that are generated by multiple laboratories using widely varying 
experimental systems and data analysis methods. Beyond the uncertainties of 
experimental design and measurement, there are several critical points in 
the subsequent data analysis workflow where lack of rigor and transparency 
may compromise the reproducibility of these laboratory results.  In this proposal, 
we focus on data recording and data pre-processing as the most basic elements 
of data analysis workflows, and we propose to develop training modules that 
provide general principles, software tools, and exercises, that will broadly 
enhance data reproducibility across the biomedical sciences. We aim to
ensure these training modules are clear, relevant, and useful to laboratory-based 
researchers, whose attention is rather to their experimental technique and collection 
of accurate data, and who may have little or no background in the use of general 
purpose software tools.  To ensure this, we will feature in these training modules 
examples of recent and ongoing NIH-funded microbiology and immunology research 
programs devoted to drug and vaccine development for infectious diseases at 
Colorado Statue University. The R programming language, and an ecosystem of
recently developed data science tools will form the technical basis for these
training modules.  There will be two instructional sequences of modules, the first
is entitled  ``Improving the Reproducibility of Experimental Data Recording'' 
and the second is ``Improving the Reproducibility of Experimental Data Pre-Processing"
Both sequences will consist of approximately 12 modules, each featuring 5 minute
to 30 minute videos, with supplemental online text, references, and practice exercises.
containing approximately 12 modules, each featuring 5--30 minute videos, with
supplemental online text, references, and practice exercises. The first sequence
will be ``Improving the Reproducibility of Experimental Data Recording", and it
will include modules on ... . The second sequence will be ``Improving the
Reproducibility of Experimental Data Pre-Processing", and it will include
modules on ... . These two sequences of training modules will be collectively
published as an open online book using the \textit{bookdown} technology. Each
module will form a chapter of this book, and will feature an embedded YouTube
video of 5--30 minutes, with accompanying text in the book to provide trainees
with a more detailed written reference they can refer to after completing the
video module.  Each module's chapter will conclude with practical exercises or
open discussion questions to complement the material taught in the video. To
ensure this material is completely free and open to researchers in the United
States, we will publish this online book and the videos under a Creative Commons
license.
