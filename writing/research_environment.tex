Colorado State University (CSU) is a Research I institution, with vibrant research programs in a variety of scientific, engineering, and health-related fields. As Colorado’s land-grant university, CSU has a 100-year-old extension program to help researchers disseminate their research results to members of the wider community. 

\textbf{Participating Departments.} The Principal Investigator and all Co-Investigators are faculty in Colorado State University's College of Veterinary \& Biomedical Sciences, in either the Department of Environmental \& Radiological Health Sciences or the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, \& Pathology. We will recruit participants for on-campus pilot testing sessions from these two departments, particularly from the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, \& Pathology, which includes over 90 faculty members, and their related research groups, most of whom are involved in biomedical research. Chairs of both departments have expressed their support for the proposed project, as has CSU's Vice President for Research (see letters from Drs. Nickoloff, Dean, and Rudolph).

\textbf{CSU Science, Technology, Education, and Mathematics (STEM) Center.} CSU's STEM Center assists STEM with education-based program and research, including designing and conducting evaluations of these programs. One of the senior evaluators at this center, Dr. Julie Maertens, has been budgeted on this grant to assist with program evaluation.

\textbf{Computer Assisted Teaching Support (CATS) Laboratory.} This laboratory is part of CSU's Academy for Teaching and Learning. The facility includes staff and equipment for professional video recording and editing, which we will use to record the video and audio components of the proposed training materials (see letter from Dr. Andrew West). 

\textbf{Lory Student Center.} CSU's Lory Student Center is in the heart of the CSU campus. It includes meeting rooms that can be freely reserved for the day-long on-campus piloting sessions that we propose to conduct to help evaluate and refine the training modules (see letter from Dr. Jac Nickoloff).

\textbf{Morgan Library.} All key CSU personnel will have full access to CSU’s Morgan Library system. In addition to print holdings, this library also provides 24-hour access to many eBooks and electronic databases of academic articles, including Web of Science and LexisNexis Academic. The library provides additional access to items outside its collections through the Prospector system, which allows CSU faculty to borrow materials from numerous participating academic and public libraries in Colorado and Wyoming. 

\textbf{Computer Services.} Each of the key personnel has adequate access to local computer equipment, which will be used for most or all of the planned grant activities. If more extensive computational resources are needed, CSU also has computational core facilities, with High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure to support research and related activities. Central IT at CSU operates, maintains and supports a 2,560 core Cray XE6, with 32 GB of RAM per node, utilizing the high-speed Gemini interconnect. Scratch storage consists of 32 TB of fast, parallel lustre storage, augmented by approximately 100 TB of expandable user storage space. The system is connected at 10 Gbps to the ultrahigh-speed research DMZ LAN. All key personnel will also have access to CSU’s on-site computing support (CSU Computer Diagnostic Center, CSU I.T. Technical Helpdesk). As faculty of CSU, the key personnel will have access to free or reduced-price site-licensed software, including Symantec AntiVirus, Adobe, EndNote, and Microsoft Office.

\textbf{Facilities} All key personnel on this grant from Colorado State University will have office space within the Department of Radiological \& Environmental Health Sciences of Colorado State University, the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, \& Radiology, or CSU's STEM Center throughout the course of the proposed research. At these offices, all key personnel will have access to department staff to aid in submitting and reporting on grants, as well as access to unlimited free printing, copying, and scanning.
