This repository has our team's proposal in response to a call from the NIH,
[RFA-GM-18-002: Training Modules to Enhance the Rigor and Reproducibility of Biomedical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-GM-18-002.html), 
submitted in June 2018.

The final, submitted files are all in the `pdf` directory. The heart of the proposal is the "research_approach" in that directory. All these pdfs were 
generated from LaTex and R code via the makefile. The phenomenal [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) package
was used to create all the tables in the proposal from R. Be sure to look for the cameo from [Puppet Roger Peng](https://twitter.com/puppetpeng?lang=en)!
